                  <h2> When I knew It was time to leave for Thailand.</h2>

        <p> Standing outside a bar in Lower Manhattan, my fists tight, waiting for the guy I called out to fight to face me. Black, like I was, and just as tall, it would had been a fair fight. I waited, but the only person who came out was his friend and co-worker, who was White.  Why do the races matter? Because the White guy called me "nigga" and what was a goodnight went downhill pretty quick. 
        </p>

          <br>


          <p> Their names escape me, but for now let's call the White guy Paul, since he looked just like Paul Wall.  Paul actually meant it with love, but I wasn't having it, for so many reasons, and when I told him that, Paul apologized.  We were cool, though his Black friend wasn't having it.  Again, despite how long we talked and drank before things got tense, I forgot the Black dude's name, so we'll call him Ham, since he's an idiot, and in my recollection, looks like a 220 pound bag of hamburger helper. </p>

          <br>

          <p> "You're just gonna disrespect my boy after all the love he showed you?" Ham had said, getting more worked up as he went on.  Shocked, I left the bar, thinking about just how ridiculous things had gotten, and sadly, I was gonna make it worse.  Staying away would had been the smart thing, but that option left a while ago; in the arms race of doing dumb shit, Ham was gonna be Iraq, and I was gonna be the U.S.</p>

          <br>

           <p>The irony of the fact that I was gonna maul another Black person in the the highly gentrified neighborhood because I refused to let his White friend call me a nigga,my nigga, a nigger or any varition of word, is not lost on me, but I was beyond mad, beyond even reason....at least for a while.  For good while, Ham never stepped outside the bar while Paul tried to talk me out of it.  Eventually, I walked away, again, and for good.  This was just one more thing, on top of so many things; from the subtle to no to subtle racism of Manhattan that my friends, family, and I deal with, failing school, my alcoholic father, and my dangerously following his footsteps, I knew I had to change.  Something had to change, I had to change, and to do that, I had to go. </p>
